### ü§î How to get an Ubuntu RDP server ?
To get an Ubuntu RDP server, you should know about: *How to use `GitHub's workflow` ?* If you are aware of GitHub's workflow usage then you must have heard about: *`inputs` (that are passed to the called workflow from the caller workflow).* If you have heard of GitHub's workflow and, *`inputs`* then it will be easy for you to get started because we gonna need some required information from you via *`inputs`*. You must be wounding: *Why is `inputs` needed ?* Well, we need them to configure following things:

| Input's field:    | Description: / Usages: / Details:                                                                    | Default values: |
| :----------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------: |
| `hostname`        | Stores your input to set host's name according to your provided information.                         | `ubuntu`        |
| `username`        | Takes input from you to create a new user as per your given instruction.                             | `user`          |
| `password`        | Asks you to enter a passcode which is used later to setup a new user.                                | `root`          |
| `Pin`             | A numeric pincode is stored to set a PIN which is used to connect with RDP server.                   | `123456`        |
| `CRP`             | Requires a command that you have to get it from [`here`](http://remotedesktop.google.com/headless).    | -               |

After getting knowledge about above informations, you have to follow the given steps to get an Ubuntu RDP server: <br>
**Step 1:** You have to clone or crate a fork of [`this`](https://github.com/Diwash0007/Ubuntu_RDP) repository either to your GitHub's account or to your GitHub's organization account. <br>
**Step 2:** Go to your cloned or forked repository and, navigate to a section named as `Actions` to run [`this`](.github/workflows/Ubuntu_RDP.yml) workflow using your GitHub's account or your GitHub's organization account. <br>
**Step 3:** You will see a workflow named as `Ubuntu RDP` select that and, click `Run workflow` button to trigger [`this`](.github/workflows/Ubuntu_RDP.yml) workflow for further operations. <br>
**Step 4:** After that, you have to fill all required fields using `inputs` from my previous explanation then again click `Run workflow` button to finally start executing [`this`](.github/workflows/Ubuntu_RDP.yml) workflow. <br>
**Step 5:** After completing run and, getting success you can see your RDP according to your provided name at [`http://remotedesktop.google.com/headless`](http://remotedesktop.google.com/headless) and, you can access it via `Pin` that you provided during provision of *`inputs`* process.
